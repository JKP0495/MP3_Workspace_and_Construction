                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings everyone, and I am thrilled to have you all joining
                                me on this new playlist of mine, NextJs. Well, to be honest, I have always resisted the
                                thought of learning new technology even whenever the need arises. I have always
                                dismissed the idea, considering that it could be done with the existing technologies we
                                already know about. However, </span><strong>learning NextJs is totally worth
                                it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NextJs is a framework you will never regret learning. This is
                                one of my favorite JavaScript frameworks. It provides endless possibilities for
                                developing beautiful applications. NextJs is a React-based production framework using
                                which we can develop React websites with great convenience.&nbsp; Well, what convenience
                                exactly does NextJs provide?</span></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It supports,</span></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server-Side
                                    Rendering (SSR)</span></li>
                            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Static Site
                                    Generation (SSG)</span></li>
                            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built-in
                                    Router&nbsp;</span></li>
                            <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a lot of
                                    other tools for SEO of websites.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, NextJs has revolutionized the process of routing
                                through its file-based routing, which we are going to learn about in the coming videos.
                                Summarising, using NextJS helps you develop React websites in a very easy, convenient,
                                and SEO-friendly way.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of NextJs, you get a lot of options for
                                rendering on your website. NextJs is a great tool for static websites with no backend
                                connections. If you wish, NextJs will provide you API routes as well, so it is not
                                simply a front-end framework but also a back-end framework in some way or the other. And
                                that enables you to program both the front end and the back end in NextJs.</span></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical react application is rendered on the client-side,
                                i.e., the Javascript bundle is loaded and then takes over to populate the dom using ajax
                                calls. And if you could somehow open the source code of some React application, you
                                wouldn't find the page content there itself because the content, in most of the cases,
                                gets populated later through JavaScript. Well, this counts as one big problem for social
                                media websites and search engines as they cannot find content in the HTML rendered by
                                the react app. Well, </span><strong>NextJs addresses all such shortcomings a simple
                                React application has, simply by introducing static site generation and server-side
                                rendering, which ships the populated DOM to the client's browser!</strong></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And further today, we will install NextJS and see what tools
                                we need to install to start using NextJs right away. And we will also set everything up
                                in that regard which I recommend you all to follow for having a smooth and convenient
                                experience building great applications. So, without any further ado, let’s get
                                started.</span></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>Installing Node.js and npm</h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow the below-mentioned steps to build the whole setup you
                                will need to start using NextJs:</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. So, move into your browsers, and we’ll start by
                                downloading Node Js and the version that is recommended for most users.</span></p>
                        <p><img src="https://codewithharry.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/42b8f8553a68005e4f51c38cd3de4509.png"
                                alt=""></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Install NodeJs through the installer with all default
                                settings. That may take some time. Wait while it finishes.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. And now, I hope you all have already downloaded and
                                installed VS Code on your systems. Download and install now, if you haven’t
                                already.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. I have created a folder named </span><em><span
                                    style="font-weight: 400;">NextJs Course</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                and this is where I’ll put all my files pertaining to the course.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Open VsCode in the same folder.</span></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you might wonder if learning JavaScript or React is
                                necessary to utilize NextJS, and my answer would be, yes! You do need to know the basics
                                but that is what I’ll do in the beginning, and knowing things as and when required.
                                We'll brush up on JavaScript basics as well as refresh our previous knowledge
                                too.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s now see how we develop Next Applications:</span></p>
                        <h3>Next App Creation</h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, one can create individual files pertaining to Next
                                applications too but we exploit a utility named</span><em><span
                                    style="font-weight: 400;"> Create Next App, </span></em><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">and you can refer to the documentation </span><a
                                href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app"><span
                                    style="font-weight: 400;">Create Next App</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                to have a knowledge of all of its uses. But that shouldn’t be a matter of worry for now
                                since I'm here. There are methods we follow to create a Next app, but we solely stick to
                                the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">yarn </span></em><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">one for its advantages over </span><em><span
                                    style="font-weight: 400;">npm</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And
                                that’s all we will cover in the coming videos while we slowly dive into the
                                playlist.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, NextJs is basically nothing but a framework for React.
                                And you will develop React only, but with a little more convenience, and better and a
                                lot more features. This concludes our discussion for today. </span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing
                                websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.
                            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I simply cannot hold my excitement while we have to
                                wait for the next video where we’ll build our first Next application.</span></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                As we just began this new topic, there is a lot more to come. See you all there in the
                                next lecture. Till then keep learning. </span></p>
